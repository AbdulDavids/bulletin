# Bulletin - Share Your World, One Note at a Time

## Introduction
Bulletin is a social media platform that empowers you to express yourself, connect with others, and engage in meaningful conversations, all while maintaining control over your online presence. Unlike traditional social networks, Bulletin offers automatic note deletion after 30 days, ensuring that your past notes won't come back to haunt you.

## Features
- **Notes, Not Tweets:** In Bulletin, a "note" is your messageâ€”a concise and impactful way to share your thoughts, ideas, and stories with the world.

- **Privacy First:** We believe in giving you control. Your notes are automatically deleted after 30 days, ensuring your online presence remains fresh and relevant.

- **Connect and Engage:** Explore trending topics, connect with like-minded individuals, and participate in global conversations through the power of notes.
